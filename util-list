basename: prints the filename of something without its path
          for some reason even of things that don't exist
          it might be useful for something maybe
cat: concatenate files
     no options, those are unnecessary
dirname: prints the directory something is on
         a bit confused about its usage or why it works the way it does
         but I guess people use it, right?
echo: print stuff to screen
      accepted options are
       -e: resolve backslash escapes
       -n: don't terminate with a newline
false: return false
       why the hell does GNU think it should even need option handling?
head: show the first n (10 by default) lines of a file
      no more, no less
logname: get username we logged in as
printenv: prints current environment variables
          it isn't that hard
sleep: wait for some seconds
       handling of special units is stupid, also if you need to wait for
       such long times why not use at or a cron job?
sync: flush cached filesystem blocks to disk
true: return true
      seriously, who in their right mind would add argument handling to these?
yes: spam something until stdout can't be written to
     a program for lazy people who hate to confirm at every prompt manually
