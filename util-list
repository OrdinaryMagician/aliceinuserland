cat: concatenate files
     no options, those are unnecessary
echo: print stuff to screen
      accepted options are
       -e: resolve backslash escapes
       -n: don't terminate with a newline
false: return false
       why the hell does GNU think it should even need option handling?
sleep: wait for some seconds
       handling of special units is stupid, also if you need to wait for
       such long times why not use at or a cron job?
true: return true
      seriously, who in their right mind would add argument handling to these?
yes: spam something until stdout can't be written to
     a program for lazy people who hate to confirm at every prompt manually
