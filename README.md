# Alice in Userland

## What is this

Alice in Userland (Au for short) is a project to make an entire set of fully functional core utilities for Linux (and in the near future maybe other systems).

## Why the name

I got some inspiration from the name of the project to port the Plan 9 coreutils to Linux, "Plan 9 from user space".

This project has gone through many names, but I decided to go with something that wasn't a punny recursive acronym or was related
to an animal.

By the way, Au is also the chemical symbol for gold.

## Why make it

I don't like how GNU is the only fully usable system to run atop the Linux kernel.

It's not like I hate GNU and the FSF or anything (well, I do dislike them a bit), I just don't find it fair that they are the only ones.

From what I've seen, GNU code is gross (really), unclean, bloated and not very easy to follow. I'm not the only one with this opinion, apparently.

Also I want to have a nice learning experience while I write all this.

## POSIX compliance

Au is only partially POSIX compliant. It kinda has too much extra spice on top of any standards compliance (while still keeping things small).

## Suggestions and criticism

As long as you're not being rude I accept any suggestions about optimizing and/or cleaning the code.

Right now I'd like to thank the people of /g/, mostly from the #/g/sicp IRC channel (nice place, BTW), their advice has really served me well.

## Coding style

If you have any complaints about my coding style, you can send them to /dev/null, thank you very much.

If I had gone with a license such as the ULS you would've been required by law to NOT criticize my coding style, but I think that's probably too mean. Besides, the ULS isn't even a serious license.
